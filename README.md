# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Early Detection Project

This repository contains my hands-on machine learning project focused on improving the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children. The goal of this project was not only to explore predictive modeling but also to strengthen my practical skills in data science and machine learning.

## Project Overview

Early detection of ASD can significantly impact intervention strategies and support for children and their families. In this project, I worked with real-world datasets to understand the patterns and factors that may help in predicting ASD. My focus was on learning by doing, experimenting with multiple machine learning techniques, and understanding their strengths and limitations.

## Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations to gain insights from the data.

Model Implementation: Tested several machine learning algorithms, including:

Random Forest

Logistic Regression

AdaBoost

Na√Øve Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Evaluation: Compared model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify which approaches were most effective for this dataset.

### Learning Outcomes

Strengthened practical skills in Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and data preprocessing techniques.

Gained hands-on experience in building, evaluating, and comparing multiple machine learning models.

Learned the importance of iterative experimentation and feature engineering when working with real-world datasets.

#### About Me

I am an undergraduate with a strong eagerness to learn and grow in data science. This project reflects my commitment to exploring new techniques, experimenting with real datasets, and improving my understanding of machine learning through hands-on experience. Every challenge in this project was an opportunity to learn something new and expand my skill set.
