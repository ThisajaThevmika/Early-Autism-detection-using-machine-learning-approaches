# Early-Autism-detection-using-machine-learning-approaches
This project applies multiple machine learning models to improve the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children, focusing on speed and accuracy. It covers the full workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation, as part of my journey to enhance my data science skills and explore AI for social good.
